# bof @ pwnable.kr

This challenge originally comes from pwnable.kr. This is the same binary and is essentially a practical walk through.
Please go and play the other challenges on the site. They are excellent.

For this challenge there are a couple of things you should know. 
..* When I first started playing pwnable.kr, it took me several days to solve this. So don't get discouraged.
..* A lot of information out there talks about overwriting the return pointer on the stack (don't worry if this doesn't make any sense at the moment). That is not the goal of this challenge
..* It's OK to watch a walkthrough as long as you walk away understanding WHY/HOW the challenge was solved.
